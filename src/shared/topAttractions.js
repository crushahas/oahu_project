        description: "This is my bf's mom's favorite Italian restaurant. She loves it so much that she randomly buys us takeout salad from there because apparently we don't eat enough vegetables. This review is solely based on the to go Italian Salad! And it was delicious. First, it is a good size. For only $6 you get a bunch of Romaine Lettuce, Peppers, Salami, Prosciutto, Olives, Cheese, Tomatoes and a good portion of dressing. Tbh, that gets them the 5th star because they aren't skimpy with dressing. I like my salad to not taste like salad.",

These originated as categories for competitors, but have become so popular that they have affected modern hula teaching and performance.",

        description: "Fifteen minutes past Hanauma Bay and beyond Sandy Beach (another popular local beach) you’ll find the large parking lot that leads to the 2-mile paved trail overlooking the lighthouse. Renovations were recently made to the lighthouse and the trail was recently repaved and additional lookout points were added. This moderately easy hike pays off with breathtaking views of the indigo ocean and Oahu’s eastern, or Windward Coast. You can even see the island of Molokai in the distance. Two other smaller islands, Manana (the larger of the two, also known as Rabbit Island) and Kaohikaipu are also visible just offshore.",
